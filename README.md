## Who are we
We're NotABum! The one-stop shop for you to get the personalized information you need to fix yourself. Ditch the bum life and join the NotABum crew – its time to go from a bum to a winner!

## What our project does
Forget wasting time like a total bum – NotABum's here to be your wingman for finding awesome ways to fill your hours. We're not talking boring old lectures here; think volunteer projects that allow you to give back to your community, hobbies that excite you, and tips to get even more done in a day. But it's not just about throwing options at you like confetti. We actually care about what makes you tick. So we ask you a few questions about yourself and give you personalized advice that you need. Skip the generic stuff and just stick to the good stuff that helps you reach your goals. 

## How to make it work
In order to make the code work, you have to make a project directory with all the files included in the repository and then run "py -3 -m venv .venv" in that directory. After that you have to move the files into the venv folder and then run ".venv\Scripts\activate". Finally, you have to run "pip install Flask" within this folder. To run the page run "python -m flask --app main run" and follow the link that's provided to see our webpage!
